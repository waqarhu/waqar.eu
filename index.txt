About me

DevOps Engineer with 10+ years of experience architecting cloud-native infrastructure, implementing automated CI/CD pipelines, and establishing comprehensive observability frameworks. Currently at ING, I engineer scalable solutions using Kubernetes, Azure DevOps, and Infrastructure-as-Code practices. My expertise spans multi-cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP), container orchestration, and building resilient distributed systems that enable rapid deployment cycles while maintaining high availability.

Technical focus areas include GitOps workflows, microservices architecture, automated testing pipelines, and SRE principles. I've successfully reduced infrastructure costs by 40% through optimization strategies, decreased deployment time by 70% via CI/CD automation, and improved system reliability with comprehensive monitoring using Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack. Proficient in Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and modern DevOps toolchains for building production-grade infrastructure.
