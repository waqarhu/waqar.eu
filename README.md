## 🚀 Getting Started

### Bash Scripts
Place your shell scripts in the `bash/` directory. Remember to:
- Make scripts executable: `chmod +x bash/your-script.sh`
- Add shebang line: `#!/bin/bash`
- Include usage documentation in comments

### Python Scripts
Place your Python scripts in the `python/` directory. Best practices:
- Use virtual environments for dependencies
- Add docstrings to functions and modules
- Include requirements.txt if needed

### Utilities
Place general-purpose utility scripts in the `utils/` directory.

### Configuration
Store configuration files, templates, and settings in the `config/` directory.

## 📝 Guidelines

1. **Documentation**: Keep scripts well-documented with comments
2. **Naming**: Use meaningful file names that describe the script's purpose
3. **Permissions**: Add execution permissions to bash scripts
4. **Examples**: Include usage examples in script headers
5. **Testing**: Test scripts before committing

## 🛠️ Tips

- Use version control for all scripts
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Add error handling to scripts
- Log important operations
- Keep secrets out of scripts (use environment variables)
